This project is focused on creating a movie recommendation system based on movie metadata and textual information. Users can input a movie title, and the system recommends similar movies based on the content and genre of the selected movie. The recommendations are presented in a web application built with Streamlit, providing an interactive and user-friendly interface for users to explore and discover movies.

The steps involved are:
1) Data Preparation
2) Data Cleaning and Transformation
3) Text Preprocessing
4) Text Vectorization
5) Cosine Similarity Calculation
6) Movie Recommendation Function
7) Integration with Streamlit
8) Data Storage
9) API Usage

Tech and libraries used: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, CountVectorizer, Streamlit, Pickle, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Bag of Words (BoW), Cosine Similarity.
